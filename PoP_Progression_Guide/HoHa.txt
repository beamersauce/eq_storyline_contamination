<c "#0080ff">  < > < > Event Info < > < > < > </c><br>
To gain access to the Temple of Marr (HoHb), you must complete the three raid trials in the basements of Halls of Honor.<br>
<br>
<c "#fc7703">  < > < > Trial 1: Trydan's Faye's Trial (Northeast)< > < > < > </c><br>
Name: <a href="https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/npc.html?id=10596">Rydda`Dar</a><br>
Level: 75<br>
HP: 050,000<br>
Max Hit: 1800+<br>

<c "#0080ff">  < > < > Event Info < > < > < > </c><br>
When the event starts, a Custodian of Marr spawns.  When it dies, Rydda`Dar spawns.<br>
Leashed, Single target ramp, slowable (disease), will despawn after one minute if not engaged.<br>

<br>
<c "#fc7703">  < > < > Trial 2: Rhaliq Trell's Trial (Northwest) < > < > < > </c><br>
<c "#0080ff">  < > < > Event Info < > < > < > </c><br>
When the event starts, a Custodian of Marr spawns.  When it dies, about a dozen mobs spawn over the three rooms along with a few villagers.<br>
If the mobs kill any villagers, the trial ends in failure.<br>
Have kiters keep the mobs busy as the raid pulls them in one or two at a time.<br>
Once everything is dead, hail Rhaliq for your flag.<br>
<br>
<c "#fc7703">  < > < > Trial 3: Alekson Garn's Trial (Southeast) < > < > < > </c><br>
<c "#0080ff">  < > < > Event Info < > < > < > </c><br>
When the event starts, a Custodian of Marr spawns.  When it dies, the event starts with 5-7 mobs spawning in each of the three rooms.<br>
Kiters can keep the ones in the 2nd and 3rd busy while the raid kills off any in the first room.  You can keep the raid in room 1 the entire event.<br>
In addition to the mobs are "virgins", if the mobs kill any of them the trial will fail, so be sure the kiters keep their distance.<br>
An SK or Necro should peel mobs off from the kiter in room two until they are all dead, then kill the named.  Then the room 3 kiter should move to room 2 and kite there, and repeat the process, while the raid stays in room 1, killing mobs and named.<br>
When all of the first room's mobs are dead, a boss, <a href="https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/npc.html?id=14950">Advocent Joran</a> (150k HP, Max Hit: 1100+), spawns.  Kill the adds, and another boss spawns, <a href="https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/npc.html?id=10945">Halgoz Rellinic</a> (175,000 HP, Max Hit: 1200+), with heavy single target rampage.<br>
When Halgoz dies, clear the adds again, and <a href="https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/npc.html?id=10917">Freegan Haun</a> (190,000 HP, Max Hit: 1200+), spawns.  Kill him for great justice.<br>
Once the three named are dead, hail Alekson in the first room for your flag.<br>
