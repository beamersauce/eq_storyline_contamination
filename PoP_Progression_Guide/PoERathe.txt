<c "#fc7703">  < > < > Boss Info < > < > < > </c><br>
Name: 12x A Rathe Councilman<br>
Level: 68<br>
HP: 300,000<br>
Max Hit: 2800+ at full HP, but goes down with hp %.<br>

<c "#0080ff">  < > < > Event Info < > < > < > </c><br>
Slowable.<br>
Buff Magic resist.<br>
Six councilmen are mezzable, six are rootable (not mezzable).  The idea (and hardest part of the encounter) is to tank one at a time and lower their hp to 5-10% so they become weak, then CC them by mezzing or rooting.<br>
They have a respawn timer of 7 minutes, and must all be dead for the Avatar of Earth to spawn.  Eventually, when you are ready, burn them all down within 7 minutes (some say within 3 mins).<br>
Classes with roots that don't break early, like Paladins, are clutch here.  2-3 Paladins should be able to keep all six rooted.  Having a bard in group for magic resist will help.<br>
The councilmen also need to be kept separate because they have a nasty PBAE.  Keep priests nearby for RGC and heals.<br>
