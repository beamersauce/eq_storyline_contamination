You have one hour for phase 1.  The raid should split into three.  Each trial can have a max of 18 people in it, for a total of 54 at once.  Either you split your raid into five groups or two goups will each do two trials in phase 1.<br>
There are five trials to complete.  Usually the Undead group will stay and continue on to phase 2, while Fire and Water merge in phase 2 and Earth and Air merge in phase 2.<br>
It is IMPERATIVE people use assist in the trials.  All adds will be mezzed, rooted, or offtanked as mobs are killed one by one.<br>
Each trial involves killing adds one by one until the boss pops.  When the trial is done, you either wait or go back to zone in to do another trial if needed (or help other ongoing trials).<br>

When the third wave dies, Rythor becomes targetable along with 2x an undead protector.<br>
